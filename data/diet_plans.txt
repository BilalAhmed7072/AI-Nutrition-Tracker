A balanced diet includes all three macronutrients in correct proportions: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 
For most adults, the ideal ratio is approximately 50% carbs, 25% protein, and 25% fats. 

For weight loss, a calorie deficit is needed, meaning you consume fewer calories than you burn. 
Increase protein intake and fiber-rich foods to stay full longer. Avoid sugary drinks and processed snacks.

For muscle gain, focus on a calorie surplus with high-protein foods such as eggs, fish, chicken, beans, and milk. 
Include strength training and ensure sufficient sleep.

A vegetarian diet can meet all nutrient needs with a variety of plant foods. 
Keto diet focuses on low-carb and high-fat intake to force the body into using fat as the main energy source.
