Water is essential for nearly every function in the human body. 
It regulates temperature, aids digestion, transports nutrients, and removes waste.

Adults should aim for 2â€“3 liters of water per day depending on climate and activity level. 
Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and poor concentration.

Fruits and vegetables such as watermelon, cucumber, and oranges also contribute to hydration. 
Limit intake of caffeine and alcohol as they increase fluid loss.

A good rule is to drink water before you feel thirsty and increase intake during exercise or hot weather.
