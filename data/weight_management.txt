Weight management is about balancing calorie intake with calorie expenditure. 
Both overconsumption and undernourishment can affect metabolism and health.

For healthy weight loss:
- Create a small calorie deficit of 300–500 kcal/day.
- Focus on whole, unprocessed foods and control portion sizes.
- Increase fiber and protein intake to stay full longer.
- Exercise regularly with a mix of cardio and strength training.

For healthy weight gain:
- Eat a calorie surplus of 300–500 kcal/day with nutrient-dense foods.
- Add snacks like nuts, dried fruits, smoothies, and peanut butter.
- Strength train to convert extra calories into muscle rather than fat.

Avoid fad diets or extreme restrictions; sustainable habits yield better long-term results.
