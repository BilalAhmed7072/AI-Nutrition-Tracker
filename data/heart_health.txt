Heart health depends largely on diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices. 
A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can help prevent cardiovascular diseases.

To support heart health:
- Reduce intake of saturated fats found in red meat, butter, and cheese.
- Avoid trans fats found in processed snacks and fried foods.
- Include omega-3 fatty acids from fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds.
- Limit salt to less than 5 grams per day to prevent high blood pressure.
- Maintain healthy cholesterol levels through a diet rich in fiber and low in processed sugar.

Regular aerobic exercise such as walking, jogging, or swimming strengthens the heart and improves circulation. 
Avoid smoking, limit alcohol, and manage stress through mindfulness or yoga.
