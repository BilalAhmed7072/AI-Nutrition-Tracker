A diabetes-friendly diet focuses on controlling blood sugar levels while providing balanced nutrition.

Key principles include:
- Choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, brown rice, and oats instead of refined sugar and white bread.
- Eat plenty of non-starchy vegetables like spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower.
- Include lean protein sources such as fish, chicken, tofu, or lentils.
- Limit sugary beverages, sweets, and fried foods.
- Eat smaller, balanced meals throughout the day to avoid glucose spikes.

Healthy fats from olive oil, avocado, and nuts can help manage cholesterol.
Regular physical activity and hydration also support blood sugar control.
