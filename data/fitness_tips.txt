Fitness is not only about exercise but a combination of physical activity, nutrition, and rest.

Basic fitness tips include:
- Perform at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily such as walking, jogging, or cycling.
- Combine cardiovascular workouts with strength training for balanced results.
- Always warm up before and stretch after exercise to prevent injuries.
- Stay hydrated and avoid training on an empty stomach.
- Sleep at least 7-8 hours per night for recovery and muscle growth.

Consistency is more important than intensity. 
Even light activity performed daily helps improve mood, metabolism, and heart health.
