Meal timing can significantly influence metabolism, energy levels, and digestion.

General recommendations:
- Eat a balanced breakfast to jumpstart metabolism and improve focus.
- Space meals 3â€“4 hours apart to maintain stable blood sugar levels.
- Avoid skipping meals, as it may lead to overeating later in the day.
- For weight loss, consider an early dinner and avoid heavy food before bedtime.
- Hydrate between meals rather than during heavy eating to aid digestion.

In fitness nutrition, post-workout meals should include both carbohydrates and protein to replenish energy and promote recovery.
