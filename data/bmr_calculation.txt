Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic functions while at rest, 
such as breathing, blood circulation, and cell repair.

The Harris-Benedict Equation is a standard method for estimating BMR.

For men:
BMR = 88.36 + (13.4 × weight in kg) + (4.8 × height in cm) − (5.7 × age)

For women:
BMR = 447.6 + (9.2 × weight in kg) + (3.1 × height in cm) − (4.3 × age)

To calculate total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), multiply BMR by an activity factor:
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly active: 1.375
- Moderately active: 1.55
- Very active: 1.725
- Extra active: 1.9

Calorie deficit leads to weight loss, while a surplus helps in weight gain.
