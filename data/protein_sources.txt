Protein is essential for muscle repair, hormone production, and maintaining body tissues. 
Adults generally need between 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, depending on activity level.

Excellent sources of protein include:
- Animal-based: eggs, chicken breast, turkey, fish, lean beef, and dairy.
- Plant-based: lentils, chickpeas, beans, soy, tofu, quinoa, and nuts.

Combining different plant proteins can ensure you get all essential amino acids. 
For example, eating rice with beans provides a complete protein profile.

Athletes and people looking to build muscle should consume protein evenly across meals and after workouts.
